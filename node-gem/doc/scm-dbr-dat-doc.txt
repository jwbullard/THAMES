# Description of the DATABR file format and example of the input DATABR file

# GEMIPM2K v. 0.780
# Prototype 28.07.2006
# Comment lines are marked with '#' and will be ignored when reading the file

# dbr-dat text input file for DATABR data generated by the GEMS-PSI GEM2MT module 
# This file should be be read after the DATACH and the IPM-DAT files

# This file (read into the DATABR memory structure) describes properties 
# of the local-equilibrium node that should be exchanged between the coupled 
# FMT and GEM parts. Hence, the DATABR data structure is the main interface
# for coupling mass transport and chemistry (see DATABR.H file).
# The DATABR file and structure contain parts of the chemical system definition 
# that may be changed by the FMT part (input data of GEM such as T, P, 
# bulk composition, metastability constraints) or are returned after 
# the GEM IPM calculation and can be utilized by the FMT part in 
# the next time iteration loop.

# The DATABR text input file consists of several sections. 
# Dimesions of all arrays in DATABR correspond to Section 2
# and the order of components and phases - to the index lists 
# in Section (4) in the DATACH file (see dch-dat-doc.txt file). 
# Here, we will refer to tags from these two sections even though
# these tags are not present in the DATABR file; it is assumed 
# that the DATACH structure exists and is correctly filled out 
# before any operation with DATABR files or structures. 

# At present, data tags and fields in this file have a fixed order, but 
# this may be changed to the arbitrary order in the following versions. 

# The actual numbers in this description are related to a particular 
# example of # the chemical system (the same as in the dch-dat-doc.txt 
# and ipm-dat-doc.txt files) and are given for illustration purposes. 
# The numbers and name lists may change if a different CSD is constructed.
