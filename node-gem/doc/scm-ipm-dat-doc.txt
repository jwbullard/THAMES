Description of the IPM-DAT file format and example of the input IPM-DAT file
(for the system containing a sorption phase). See also the accompanying 
"scm-dch-dat-doc.txt" and "scm-dbr-dat-doc.txt" files.

# GEMIPM2K v. 0.780
# Prototype 28.07.2006
# Comment lines are marked with '#' and will be ignored when reading the file

# ipm-dat text input file for GEM-IPM specific data generated by the 
# GEMS-PSI GEM2MT module 
# This file should be be read after the DATACH file and before the DATABR file

# The IPM-DAT file is complementary to the DATACH file. 
# The IPM-DAT file contains parts of chemical system definitions (CSD) that are 
# used by GEM IPM part but not visible to the FMT part of the coupled code. 
# Contents of this file will be placed in the MULTI internal work structure 
# of GEM IPM, not visible outside of it. 

# The IPM-DAT text input file consists of six sections, of which 
# section (1) contains numerical controls of GEM IPM algorithm operation
# and convergence; section (2) contains dimensionalities for additional
# memory allocation for surface complexes (main dimensionalities of the 
# chemical system are given in DATACH file); section (3) defines the 
# presence and data for mixing models of multi-component phases and, 
# if necessary, the arrays of non-ideality parameters; sections (4) and
# (5) provides some complete data arrays that may be incomplete in DATABR 
# file(s); section (6) contains some initial data for phases; and, 
# finally, section (7) contains initial data for sorption (surface 
# complexation) phases, it is present if set in section (2). 

# In this version, there is a fixed order of data fields, each beginning 
# with a tag - a data name in <>. This may be changed to the arbitrary 
# order in the forthcoming versions. 

# The actual numbers in this description are related to a particular example 
# of the chemical system and are given for illustration purposes. 
# The numbers and name lists may change if a different CSD is constructed. 

# ID key of the initial chemical system definition

## Section (1): Controls of operation of the GEM IPM numerical algorithm

# (the built-in subroutine will be used for the non-ideal model). The 
# sixth character is either 'N' or the code of most complex EDL model 
# used in sorption phases. 
# The first character can be 'I' (ideal solution) or another character 
# which defines the built-in subroutine for calculation of activity 
# coefficients on GEM IPM iterations to be used for this phase).
# Some possible built-in subroutine codes:  
# 'G' - binary Guggenheim (Redlich-Kister) subregular solid solution;

#    ion-size parameter a0 (Angstrom) and common b_gamma parameter; 
#    requires <LsMod>[0] = 8; the parameters are given in <PMc>[5] (a0) 
#    and <PMc>[6] (b_gamma), respectively (<PMc> indexation starts 
#    from [0]);

#    (Kielland) ion-size parameter a0 (Angstrom), taken from <DMc> vector
#    (<LsMdc>[0] = 1), and common b_gamma parameter given in <PMc>[6] (<PMc> 
#    indexation starts from [0], requires <LsMod>[0] = 8);
