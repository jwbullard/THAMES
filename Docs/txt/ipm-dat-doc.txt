Description of the IPM_DAT file format and example of the input IPM_DAT file

# GEMIPM2K v. 0.98
# Prototype 12.12.2006
# Comment lines are marked with '#' and will be ignored when reading the file

# The IPM_DAT text input file contains data that are used only within the GEM-IPM-2 numerical algorithm
# but not exchanged between the FMT and GEM parts. Among this input data, the most important are 
# numerical controls of GEM-IPM-2 operation and convergence, as well as the parameters and flags 
# defining the non-ideal solution and sorption models. 

# The easiest way to obtain an initial IPM_DAT file is to generate it together with the DCH_DAT file 
# and DBR_DAT file(s) using the GEMS-PSI GEM2MT module (or the "Data" "Write IPM files" menu command 
# on the "Single Chemical System" dialog). 

# The GEMIPM2K program reads the IPM_DAT file only once, after the DCH_DAT file and before any DBR_DAT
# files. Entire content of the IPM_DAT file will be placed in the IPM (MULTI) internal work structure 
# of GEM IPM-2, not visible outside of it. 

# The IPM-DAT text input file consists of several logical sections, of which:
# sections (1) and (2) contain flags and dimensionalities for additional memory allocation for 
# surface complexes (main dimensionalities of the chemical system are given in the DCH_DAT file);
# section (3) contains numerical controls of GEM IPM algorithm operation and convergence;  
# section (4) defines the presence and data for mixing models of multi-component phases and, 
# if necessary, the arrays of non-ideality parameters; 
# sections (5) and (6) provide some complete data arrays that may be incomplete in DATABR file(s); 
# section (7) contains some initial data for phases; and, finally, section (8) contains initial data 
# for sorption (surface complexation) phases, present if the respective flags and dimensionalities 
# are set in section (2). 

# The IPM-DAT file consists of one or more input data objects (fields) and comment lines. A comment 
# line begins with the '#' character in the first position; by reading the file, anything after '#' 
# will be ignored until the line end code(s). Any data object field begins with a tag - an identifier
# in angle brackets <>. The tag is followed by one or more values, depending on the type and dimensions 
# of the data object. The data objects which define dimensionalities for other data objects must 
# always be provided in the beginning of file, before the reserved tag <END_DIM>. 
# Other data objects may follow in any order (although it is recommended to keep them in logical 
# sections, as seen after printing the file from the GEMS code and described below). 
# Many data data objects located after the <END_DIM> tag can be skipped from the input IPM_DAT file; 
# if the data object is omitted, its tag must be absent together all values; part of values cannot 
# be skipped. When a data object is not present in the input file, the default values will be assigned 
# to all its elements in the in the program memory. 
# However, if some optional dimensions are set (e.g. <Lads>) before the <END_DIM> tag then at least 
# obligatory data objects connected to it must also be provided in rest of the input file.

# Obligatory data objects that cannot be skipped are marked below with "***" in the comment line.   

# The actual numbers in this description are related to a particular example of the chemical system 
# and are given for illustration purposes. The numbers and name lists may change if a different 
# Chemical System Definition (CSD) will be constructed. 

# *** ID key of the initial chemical system definition (is printed from GEMS in GEMS SysEq record key 
# format, can also be entered by hand as any string shorter than 64 characters taken in ""). 
# This string is used only for identification purposes in output files printed from GEMIPM2K, 
# or for debugging.

## (Section 1) Important flags that affect memory allocation.
# *** Flag for using electroneutrality condition in GEM IPM calculations (should be set to 1 if 
# an Independent Component "charge" ("Zz") is present in the system definition; this flag may be
# automatically switched off to 0 during GEM calculation if e.g. aqueous phase has been eliminated)
<pa_PE>            1

# Flag for the volume balance constraint (on Vol IC) - for indifferent equilibria at P_Sat 
# (not used in this version). If PV = 1 then the Independent Component "Vol" must be included 
# for the volume balance. The usual (default) value of PV is 0.
<PV>               0

# Total number of DCs in liquid hydrocarbon phases (for the old FGL module, will soon be obsolete).
# Default value is 0. 
<PSOL>             0

## The following two flags must be set on (+) if sorption phases are present in the system definition.
# Flag for using (+) or ignoring (-) specific surface areas of phases; default value is '+'. 
<PAalp>          '+'

# Flag for using (+) or ignoring (-) specific surface free energies of phase-aqueous and phase-gas # interfaces; default value is '+'. 
<PSigm>          '+'

## Section (2) Important additional dimensionalities that affect memory allocation in the MULTI 
# data structure. 
# *** Total number of Dependent Components in sorption phases included into this system. If Lads > 0 
# and FIa > 0 then the data section (7) must be provided at the end of this file (see also # the "scm-ipm-dat-doc.txt" file as an example).
<Lads>             0

# *** Number of sorption phases included in this system (0 if no sorption phases are included).
<FIa>              0

# *** Actual maximum number of surface types per adsorption phase (if FIa > 0, <FIat> must be set to 6). 
<FIat>             0

## Section (3): Controls of operation of the GEM IPM numerical algorithm. These settings should 
## be changed carefully, only if you know what you are doing. Wrong control values and flags may 
## strongly affect convergence, accuracy and performance of GEM IPM-2, cause it to crash or produce 
## meaningless results. In most cases, the default values work just fine. 
#
# Minimum amount of Independent Component in the bulk system composition (except charge "Zz"), moles 
# (may be set in the interval 1e-17 < DB < 1e-7). Default value: 1e-17. 
# This parameter is used in the IPM-2 balance precision controls. 
<pa_DB>        1e-17

# Maximum allowed mass balance residual (moles) for major Independent Components (may be set in 
# the interval 1e-10 < DHB < 1e-6). Default value: 1e-8. 
<pa_DHB>       1e-08

# Precision criterion of the simplex() procedure to obtain the automatic initial approximation 
# (may be set in the interval 1e-10 < EPS < 1e-6). Default value: 1e-7. 
<pa_EPS>       1e-07  

# IPM-2 convergence threshold for the Dikin criterion (may be set in the interval 1e-6 < DK < 1e-3, 
# the default value of 1e-4 is strongly recommended). 
# Setting too low DK < 1e-5 may dramatically increase the number of IPM iterations, slow the 
# convergence down, and deteriorate the quality and mass balance precision of the GEM IPM result.
# Too large DK value may result in wrong GEM solution or unrealistic phase assemblage.   
<pa_DK>       0.0001

# Threshold for the application of the Karpov phase stability criterion f_a (diagnostic criterion 
# for determining which phases are stable (|f_a| <= DF) and which are not (|f_a| > DF). Used in 
# Selekt-2 procedure for checking the correctness of stable phase assemblage. 
# Default is 0.01; it is not recommended to change this value. 
<pa_DF>         0.01

# Maximum allowed number of iterations in the EnterFeasibleDomain() procedure (can be set 
# between 10 and 200). Default value: 144. If the procedure has not converged in DP iterations, 
# this usually means that chemical system definition (CSD) is wrong or there are errors in 
# stoichiometry of some Dependent Components. 
<pa_DP>          144

# Maximum allowed number of iterations in the MainIPM_Descent() procedure. Usual number of IPM 
# iterations after the simplex() initial approximation is between 20 and 100, after reading 
# the previous GEM solution as initial approximation - ca. 10 to 20 times less. 
# In highly non-ideal systems with fluid(s) and many solid solutions, more than 300 iterations 
# may be required. If GEM IPM-2 algorithm has not converged in IIM iterations, this usually 
# means that chemical system definition (CSD) or thermodynamic data is inconsistent, or 
# there are problems with some non-ideal mixing models. Another reason may be that <pa_DK> is 
# set too low. Default IIM value: 500. 
<pa_IIM>         500

# Control on calling built-in Debye-Hueckel() and other models for aqueous activity coefficients 
(internal control, do not change). Default value: 3. 
<pa_PD>            3

# Negative number (from -1 to -20): the number |PRD| of additional full IPM-2 loops to improve 
# the GEM final solution in highly non-ideal systems (especially around the critial point in some
# phases). Positive number: no additional loops, IPM_gamma() is called on each GEM iteration.
# Default value: 3.  
<pa_PRD>          -1

# Smoothing parameters controlling IPM convergence in highly non-ideal systems. AG can be set 
# between 0.7 and 1.0; DGC between 0.01 and 0.1. If there are no non-ideal solutions in the system 
# then it is best to set AG = 1. Default values: AG = 0.7; DGC = 0.07. 
<pa_AG>            1
<pa_DGC>        0.07

# Flag for using initial activity coefficients <lnGmf> for simplex() initial approximation 
# (1-enable, 0-disable). Default value: 1. See <lnGmf> and <pa_GAH> for more details. 
<pa_PSM>           1

# components (default 1) and GAH for minor components (default 1000).  
<pa_GAR>           1
<pa_GAH>        1000

# Cutoff threshold for the elimination of a phase if its amount goes below this threshold. 
# Values can be set between 1e-7 and 1e-12 mol. Default value: 1e-12. Elimination of a phase 
# means that amounts of all its components in the X vector (primal solution) will be set to 
# zero and calculation of activity coefficients skipped on remaining GEM iterations. Elimination 
# of phases and components (if DS > 1e-10) may significantly affect the mass balance residuals. 
<pa_DS>        1e-09

# Cutoffs for elimination of: Xw water solvent (default 1e-9); Sc - solid sorbent (default
# 1e-7); Dc - solution or surface species (default 1e-20); Ph - non-electrolyte solution phases 
# (default 1e-10). Elimination of the sorbent or solvent results in the elimination of the whole
# aqueous or sorption phase.

# Mode of Selekt2() procedure operation (do not change the default value 1). To be completed. 
<pa_PC>            1

# Threshold of Karpov stability criterion f_a for insertion of a phase in Selekt2() procedure. 
# After completion of the main IPM descent, this procedure calculates the Karpov phase stability
# criterion f_a for each (also eliminated from mass balance) phase. If any phase with f_a > DFM 
# ("oversaturation") is detected, the Selekt2() procedure inserts its components into the X and 
# XF vectors and passes the control to EnterFeasibleDomain(). This loop can be repeated up to 3 
# times; usually, a consistent solution is obtained in 1 or 2 Selekt2() loops. If not, then, most 
# probably, thermodynamic data is inconsistent.    
<pa_DFM>        0.1

# Insertion amounts (moles) used after the simplex() initial approximation and in the Selekt2() 
# procedure for zeroed-off species and phases (usually no need to change):
# DFYw - water solvent (default 1e-6);
<pa_DFYw>      1e-06
# DFYaq - aqueous species (default 1e-6);
<pa_DFYaq>     1e-06
# DFYid - ideal solution components (default 1e-6);

# Insertion amount of single-component phase in Selekt2() algorithm only (default 1e-6).
<pa_DFYs>      1e-06
# The above insertion amounts determine the mass balance residuals in the "normal-precision" 
# IPM-1 algorithm, and the behavior of the high-precision IPM-2 refinement algorithm. More 
# about these precision refinements can be found in the pdf documentation on GEMS-PSI web page.  

## Parameters and controls of the high-accuracy IPM-2 algorithm. In principle, they are needed
## only if some total amounts of Independent Components (except charge) are less than 1e-5 mol.
# Number of the IPM-2 enhancement loops for obtaining the high-accuracy improved mass balance 
# (from 0 to 15), default value 14. 
<pa_DW>            0

# Exponent for dual-thermodynamic restoring of very low amounts of solutes (+2 to -5), relative to 
# <pa_DHBM> (default 0 or -2 for sorption models). 
<pa_DT>            0

# IPM-2 balance accuracy control ratio DHBM[i]/b[i], determines the maximum allowed mass balance 
# residual for minor Independent Components (value of 0.001 means 1% residual relative to the total
# IC amount in the system). Minor ICs are those with total amount less than 1e-5 mol.  
<pa_GAS>       0.001

## Controls for surface complexation models
# Standard surface density (nm-2) for calculating activity of surface species (do not change 
# unless a different standard value is used in the supplied thermodynamic database). 
# Default is 12.05 nm-2. 
<pa_DNS>       12.05

# Convergence parameter of SACT calculation in sorption/surface complexation models (can be 
set between 0.01 and 0.000001). Default value is 0.001. 
<pa_IEPS>      0.001

# Flag for using metastability/kinetic constraints on calculated amounts of Dependent Components
# (see <DLL>, <DUL> arrays). Possible values: 1 (on) or 0 (off). Default value is 1 (on). 
<pKin>             1

# Tolerance on the amount of DC with two-side metastability constraints if set equal in 
# <DLL>, <DUL> arrays. The program will use lower constrains DLL[j]-DKIN and upper constraints

## (Section 4) Initial data for multicomponent phases (see DCH_DAT file for the dimension <nPS>) 
## and optional mixing model parameters. See another example in the "ipm-ss-dat-doc.txt" file. 
# *** Codes for mixing models of multicomponent phases: six characters per phase. Of these six 
# characters, the second, third and fifth must be set to 'N'. The fourth character can be 
# either 'I' (ideal mixing) or 'S' (the built-in subroutine will be used for the non-ideal model). 
# Note that only built-in mixing models are allowed in GEMIPM2K (i.e. no phase scripts).
# The sixth character is either 'N' or code of the most complex EDL model used in sorption phases
# (e.g. 'T'). The first character can be 'I' (ideal solution) or another character which defines 
# the built-in subroutine for calculation of activity coefficients on GEM IPM iterations to be 
# used for this phase. The 'I' code implies <LsMdc>[0] = 0 and <LsMod>[0] = 0.
# Some possible built-in subroutine codes (under revision, may be changed soon):  
# 'G' - binary Guggenheim (Redlich-Kister) subregular solid solution; requires <LsMod>[k] = 3 
#       and 3 parameters (a0, a1, a2) to be provided in the <PMc> array for this phase;
# 'M' - binary Margules subregular solid solution with T,P dependent parameters; requires

#       array for this phase;
# 'T' - ternary Margules regular solid solution with T,P dependent parameters; requires 
#       <LsMod>[k] = 12 and 4 x 3 parameters (Wu, Ws, Wv) to be provided in the <PMc> array

# 'H' - Extended Debye-Hueckel equation for aqueous species with common ion-size parameter a0 
#       (Angstrom) and common b_gamma parameter; requires <LsMod>[0] = 8; the parameters are 
#       given in <PMc>[5] (a0) and <PMc>[6] (b_gamma), respectively (<PMc> indexation starts 
#       from [0], requires <LsMod>[0] = 8);

#       parameter a0 (Angstrom), provided in the <DMc> vector (<LsMdc>[0] = 1), and common b_gamma 
#       parameter given in <PMc>[6] (<PMc> indexation starts from [0], requires <LsMod>[0] = 8);

#       a0 (Angstrom), taken from <DMc> vector (requires <LsMdc>[0] = 1 and <LsMod>[0] = 0);
# '1' - Debye-Hueckel limiting law for aqueous species, without the ion-size parameter 
#      (requires <LsMdc>[0] = 0 and <LsMod>[0] = 0);
# 'D' - Davies equation for aqueous species (requires <LsMdc>[0] = 0 and <LsMod>[0] = 0);
