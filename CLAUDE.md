# THAMES Project - Claude Context

## Project Overview

THAMES is a GTK-based application for advanced cement hydration simulation, using the THAMES-Hydration C++ simulator. This project is based on the VCCTL architecture but adapted for the upgraded hydration simulation engine.

**Based on:** VCCTL v10.0.0
**Hydration Engine:** THAMES-Hydration (C++)
**Started:** November 2025

## Key Differences from VCCTL

### Hydration Simulator
- **VCCTL:** Uses disrealnew.c (C implementation)
- **THAMES:** Uses THAMES-Hydration (C++ implementation)

### Input Generation
[To be documented during migration]

### Output Format
[To be documented during migration]

### Microstructure Generation
[To be documented during migration]

## Development Sessions

### Session 1: Repository Setup
November 15, 2025 (Morning)
- Created THAMES repository
- Copied VCCTL infrastructure
- Added THAMES-Hydration as git submodule
- Initial project documentation
- THAMES C++ code analysis

### Session 2: GEMS Integration & Materials Architecture
November 15, 2025 (Afternoon)
- **GEMS Database Integration**: Added GEMS3K thermodynamic database files to src/data/gems/
- **GEMS Parser Service**: Built comprehensive parser for thames-dch.dat (180 DCs, 92 phases)
- **Virtual Environment**: Set up thames-env with all dependencies (PyGObject 3.52.3)
- **Phase Mappings**: Documented VCCTL→GEMS phase name mappings for migration
  - Cement phases: 9 phases mapped (C3S→Alite, C2S→Belite, etc.)
  - Limestone phases: 4 phases identified
  - Fly ash phases: 8 typical phases documented
- **Materials Architecture**: Designed tag-based material system
  - Materials store phase composition only (no kinetics)
  - Kinetic parameters defined in Mix Design
  - Flexible tags instead of rigid categories
  - Migration plan: cements and limestones only
- **See**: SESSION_SUMMARY_2025_11_15.md for complete details

## MANDATORY: Cross-Platform Safety Protocol

**CRITICAL: Before making ANY change to these files, ALWAYS check both platforms:**
- `.spec` files (thames-macos.spec, thames-windows.spec)
- Path-related code (directories_service.py, config_manager.py, app_info.py)
- Build scripts (build_macos.sh, any Windows build scripts)
- Hooks directory

**Required checks for EVERY change:**

1. **Read BOTH platform spec files:**
   ```bash
   grep -n "relevant_pattern" thames-macos.spec
   grep -n "relevant_pattern" thames-windows.spec
   ```

2. **State explicitly BEFORE making the change:**
   - "This change affects: [macOS / Windows / both]"
   - "Windows currently does: [X]"
   - "macOS currently does: [Y]"
   - "After this change: [Z]"
   - "This will/won't break Windows because: [reason]"

3. **For path changes specifically:**
   - Check where files are bundled in BOTH specs
   - Check where code looks for them in the Python files
   - Verify the paths match on BOTH platforms after the change

**Failure to follow this protocol causes platform regressions and wastes user time.**

## Git commands
- Do not run a git command unless you are requested to do so
- Use "git add -A" to stage changes before committing to the git repository

## Responses
- Do not use the phrase "You're absolutely right!". Instead, use the phrase
"Good point.", or "I see what you are saying."

## OS Switching Procedures (CRITICAL - READ FIRST)

### **Cross-Platform Development Workflow**

When working on THAMES across multiple operating systems (Mac, Windows, Linux), use these scripts to keep git repositories synchronized:

#### **Starting Work on Different OS:**

```bash
./pre-session-sync.sh
```

**What it does:**
- Fetches latest changes from remote
- Shows what commits will be pulled
- Creates automatic backup branch
- Pulls changes with rebase strategy
- Verifies sync completed successfully

**When to use:**
- ALWAYS at start of session on different OS
- After long break between sessions
- When you suspect changes on remote

#### **Ending Work Session:**

```bash
./post-session-sync.sh
```

**What it does:**
- Shows all uncommitted changes
- Prompts for commit message (or auto-generates)
- Stages all changes with `git add -A`
- Creates commit with standard format
- Pushes to remote repository

**When to use:**
- ALWAYS at end of work session
- Before switching to different OS
- Before long breaks

## Key Technical Patterns

### PyInstaller Path Resolution:
```python
# WRONG - breaks in PyInstaller:
project_root = Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent

# RIGHT - use service abstraction:
operations_dir = self.service_container.directories_service.get_operations_path()
```

### Platform-Specific subprocess:
```python
popen_kwargs = {'stdout': ..., 'stderr': ...}
if sys.platform == 'win32':
    popen_kwargs['creationflags'] = subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW
process = subprocess.Popen(cmd, **popen_kwargs)
```

### Cross-Platform User Data Directories:
- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/THAMES/`
- **Windows:** `%LOCALAPPDATA%\THAMES\`
- **Linux:** `~/.local/share/THAMES/`

# Important Instructions
Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
