## pyrragg-298K-sat

The input files in this directory will simulate the redox reactions for an
aggregate particle containing some pyrrhotite under saturated conditions at
298 K under saturated conditions.

The system is 300 x 300 x 50 voxels, with each voxel being 157 micrometers in
dimension.

The user may edit the simparams.json file to change the moisture conditions from saturated
to sealed.
