time_ in the Lattice is: 56
Now emptying the necessary pore volume:  
Finding and sorting all potential void sites ... OK, found 104 potential void sites.
***netsites[Void] in this state = 104; cursites = 110064 and newsites = 110168
***netsites[Electrolyte] in this state = -104; cursites = 285192 and newsites = 285088

Target CAPIILARY WATER volume fraction IS 0.285092
Number CAPILLARY VOXELS actually emptied was:  104
