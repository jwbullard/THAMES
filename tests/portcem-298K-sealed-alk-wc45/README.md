The input files in this directory will simulate the hydration of a w/c = 0.45 paste
of cement CCRL 140 at 298 K under sealed conditions.  The initial solution has
a KOH concentration of 10 mmol/kgw

The system is 100 x 100 x 100 voxels, with each voxel being 1 micrometer in
dimension.

The user may edit the simparams.json file to change the moisture conditions from sealed
to saturated, or change the composition of the starting solution.
