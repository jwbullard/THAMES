## PC-Carbonate-200

The input files in this directory will simulate the hydration of a w/c = 0.45 paste
of cement CCRL 140 at 296 K under saturated conditions with 20 % by mass
replacement forsterite for the cement. The electrolyte has a fixed dissolved
NaHCO3 concentration of 100 mmol/L.

The system is 200 x 200 x 200 voxels, with each voxel being 1 micrometer in
dimension.

The user may edit the simparams.json file to change the moisture conditions from saturated
to sealed.
