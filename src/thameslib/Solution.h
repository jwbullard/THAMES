This class keeps track of the composition of the aqueous solution, and

The solution is kept separate from the ChemicalSystem because we
often want to just know the driving force (saturation index) for
dissolution or precipitation of solid phases.  Therefore we may
want to set the upper limit of solid phases to a very low number
approximating zero.

@note This class's members consist almost entirely of a subset of the

of this class and then access the members that way.

/**
@brief Calculate the site strain based on local crystallization pressure.

The calculation of local crystallization pressure happens in this method,
based on the saturation index of the phase.  Therefore, the method is
currently restricted to problems of sulfate attack, and it probably can
be generalized somewhat.

Assuming that the saturation index \f$\beta\f$ is known for the phase,
then the crystallization pressure should be the difference in the Laplace pressure
between the large pore entrance, \f$r_{cp}\f$, and the size of the average gel
pore, \f$r_{gp}\f$.  This pressure difference is

\f[
    p_c = 2 \gamma \left[ \frac{1}{r_{gp} - \delta} - \frac{1}{r_{cp} - \delta} \right]
\f]

where we subtract \f$\delta\f$, the liquid film thickness, so that the terms in
the denominator are the radii of curvature of the actual crystal in these two
locations.

In THAMES, we <i>assume</i> that the largest pore entrance to the gel porosity
is about half the size of a lattice site.  The usual dimension of a lattice site
in THAMES is 1 micrometer--- <b>although this is not necessary</b>--- so we assume
that \f$r_{cp} = 500\f$ nm.

The Thompson-Freundlich relation tells us the size of a crystal that is in equilibrium
with a supersaturated solution with saturation index, relative to that crystal,
of \f$\beta\f$.  The condition of equilibrium is that the chemical potential of
formula units in the crystal be equal to the chemical potential of dissolved formula
units in the solution:

\f[
    V_c \gamma \kappa_{cr} = R T \ln \frac{Q}{K} = R T \ln \beta
\f]

where \f$V_c\f$ is the stress-free molar volume of the crystal, \f$\gamma\f$ is the
surface energy of the crystal-liquid interface, \f$\kappa_{cr}\f$ is the mean
curvature of the crystal in equilibrium with the solution, <i>R</i> and <i>T</i>
are the gas constant and absolute temperature, respectively, and <i>Q</i> and
<i>K</i> are the activity product and equilibrium constant of the crystal dissociation
reaction.  Therefore, the mean curvature is

\f[
    \kappa_{cr} = \frac{R T}{V_c \gamma} \ln \beta
\f]

And since \f$\kappa_{cr} \equiv 2/r_{cr}\f$, we have \f$r_{cr} = 2/\kappa_{cr}\f$
But \f$r_{gp}\f$ is the radius of curvature of the gel pore, not the crystal, so
we must add the liquid film thickness: \f$r_{gp} = r_{cr} + \delta\f$.

With the crystallization pressure, <i>p</i><sub>c</sub>, calculated, we must
now estimate the local strain.  Ordinarily, this could be done only with detailed
knowledge of the local pore structure.  However, to make the calculation tractable,
we adopt the assumptions of poromechanics, in which case the strain is estimated
by a volume-averaged equation,

\f[
    \epsilon_x \approx \left( \frac{1}{3 K_p} - \frac{1}{3 K_s} \right)
    \left[ \phi p_c + pl - p_{atm} \right]
\f]

where \f$\epsilon_x\f$ is the linear strain (strain is assumed to be isotropic),
<i>K</i><sub>p</sub> and <i>K</i><sub>s</sub> are the volume averaged bulk and
shear moduli of the porous body, \f$\phi\f$ is the local porosity, <i>p</i><sub>l</sub>
is the hydrostatic pressure in the liquid film, and <i>p</i><sub>atm</sub> is
atmospheric pressure.

@todo Consider renaming this function to calcCrystallizationStrain.

@param SI is the saturation index of the growing crystal
@param porevolfrac is the local porosity
@param Kp is the effective bulk modulus of the porous body
@param Ks is the effective shear modulus of the porous body
