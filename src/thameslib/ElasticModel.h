@brief Declaration of the ElasticModel base class for finite element calculations.

@section Background  
This program solves the linear elastic equations in a
random linear elastic material, subject to an applied macroscopic strain,
using the finite element method.  Each pixel in the 3D digital
image is a cubic tri-linear finite element,  having its own
elastic moduli tensor. Periodic boundary conditions are maintained.
In the comments below, (USER) means that this is a section of code that
the user might have to change for his particular problem. Therefore the
user is encouraged to search for this string.

@section Problem and Variable Definitions
The problem being solved is the minimization of the energy
\f$1/2 u \cdot A \cdot u + b \cdot u + C\f$, where <i>A</i> is
the Hessian matrix composed of the stiffness matrices (`dk`) for each
pixel/element, <i>b</i> is a constant vector and <i>C</i> is a constant
that are determined by the applied strain and
the periodic boundary conditions, and <i>u</i> is a vector of
all the displacements. The solution
method used is the conjugate gradient relaxation algorithm.
Other variables are:  `gb` is the gradient = Au+b, `h` is an
auxiliary variable used in the conjugate gradient algorithm (in dembx),
`dk`(n,i,j) is the stiffness matrix of the n'th phase, `cmod`(n,i,j) is
the elastic moduli tensor of the n'th phase, `pix` is a vector that gives
the phase label of each pixel, `ib` is a matrix that gives the labels of
the 27 (counting itself) neighbors of a given node, `prob` is the volume
fractions of the various phases,
`strxx`, `stryy`, `strzz`, `strxz`, `stryz`, and `strxy` are the six Voigt
volume averaged total stresses, and
`sxx`, `syy`, `szz`, `sxz`, `syz`, and `sxy` are the six Voigt
volume averaged total strains.

@section Dimensions
The vectors `u`,`gb`,`b`, and `h` are dimensioned to be the system size,
`ns`=nx*ny*nz, with three components, where the digital image of the
microstructure considered is a rectangular paralleliped, nx x ny x nz
in size.  The arrays `pix` and `ib` are are also dimensioned to the system
size.  The array ib has 27 components, for the 27 neighbors of a node.
Note that the program is set up at present to have at most 50
different phases.  This can easily be changed, simply by changing
the dimensions of `dk`, `prob`, and `cmod`. The parameter `nphase` gives the
number of phases being considered in the problem.
All arrays are passed between subroutines using simple common statements.
