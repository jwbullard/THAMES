/**
@class Controller
@brief Controls the running of simulation iterations.

The `Controller` class is the hub for THAMES simulations.  It has pointers
to all the other major objects that are instantiated by THAMES, including
the KineticModel, the ThermalStrain, the ChemicalSystem, and the Lattice
that are associated with the system.

The `Controller` object is also responsible for running each iteration
of the simulation and deciding which modules to run based on whether
hydration, leaching, or sulfate attack is desired.

In THAMES, the `Lattice` class can be thought of as the system.
By itself, it can identify what materials it contains, the properties of
the materials, the temperature, current age, degree of hydration, etc.
However, the `Lattice` class does not possess a <i>driver</i> to
control the microstructure development.  This latter
functionality is contained in the `Controller` class, which operates
directly on the `Lattice` to determine how to modify the lattice at
each time step specified in the phase input file.

THAMES keeps track of physical and chemical data
about individual material phases, including
specific gravity, internal porosity, composition, molar volume, etc.  All the
phases are stored in a phase database.

The ultimate objective of the `Controller` class is to cycle through
the phase input file data, and to modify the lattice accordingly at each
time step.
