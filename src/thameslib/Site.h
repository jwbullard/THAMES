  @brief Ranking of potential for dissolution if the site is an interface site.

  The wmc (acronym for weighted mean curvature) is a quantitative ranking of the
  potential for a site's phase to dissolve based on its local environment.  It
  is kind of like mean curvature, but potentially can be weighted to account for
  crystalline anisotropy.

  THAMES is not currently able to quantitatively calculate wmc as defined in
  the metallurgy literature:

      - Taylor, J.E., Cahn, J.W., Handwerker, C.E., Geometric models of crystal
          growth, Acta metall. mater. 40 [7] (1992) 1443--1474.
      - Taylor, J.E., II--Mean curvature and weighted mean curvature,
          Acta metall. mater. 40 [7] (1992) 1475--1485.

  Instead, THAMES uses the digital template method to calculate a quantity that
  is roughly linearly proportional to mean curvature:

      - Bullard, J.W., Garboczi, E.J., Carter, W.C., Fuller, E.J., Numerical
          methods for computing interfacial mean curvature, Comput. Mater. Sci.
          4 (1995) 103--116.

  This provides a ranking of dissolution potential only.
