@brief Defines the strainenergy vector.

The strainenergy vector stores the elastic strain energy associated with
each microstructure phase, which is then communicated to the GEM3K library
as a modification to the standard Gibbs energy of formation of those phases.
This is therefore a way to modify the usual thermodynamic calculations to
account for elastic strain energy.
