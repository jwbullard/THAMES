@class AppliedStrain
@brief Solves the linear elastic state of the finite element mesh.

@section intro_sec Introduction
This program solves the linear elastic equations in a
random linear elastic material, subject to an applied macroscopic strain,
using the finite element method.  Each pixel in the 3D digital
image is a cubic tri-linear finite element,  having its own
elastic moduli tensor. Periodic boundary conditions are maintained.
In the comments below, notes are given for sections of code that
the user might have to change for his particular problem. Therefore the
user is encouraged to search for this string.

@subsection p_and_v Problem and Variable Definitions

The problem being solved is the minimization of the energy
@f[
E = \frac{1}{2} u \cdot A \cdot u + b \cdot u + C
@f]
where <i>A</i> is the Hessian matrix composed of the
stiffness matrices (dk) for each pixel/element, <i>b</i> is a constant vector
and <i>C</i> is a constant that are determined by the applied strain and
the periodic boundary conditions, and <i>u</i> is a vector of
all the displacements. The solution
method used is the conjugate gradient relaxation algorithm.
Other variables are:
    - `gb` is the gradient, <i>Au</i> + <i>b</i>
    - `h` is an  auxiliary variable used in the conjugate gradient algorithm (in
dembx)
    - `dk(n,i,j)` is the stiffness matrix of the n'th phase
    - `cmod(n,i,j) is the elastic moduli tensor of the n'th phase
    - `pix` is a vector that gives  the phase label of each pixel
    - `ib` is a matrix that gives the labels of the 27 (counting itself)
       neighbors of a given node
    - `prob` is the volume   fractions of the various phases
    - `strxx`, `stryy`, `strzz`, `strxz`, `stryz`, and `strxy` are the six Voigt
volume averaged total stresses
    - `sxx`, `syy`, `szz`, `sxz`, `syz`, and `sxy` are the six Voigt volume
averaged total strains.

@subsection dims Dimensions
The vectors `u`, `gb`, `b`, and `h` are dimensioned to be the system size,
@f$n_s = n_x n_y n_z@f$, with three components, where the digital image of the
microstructure considered is a rectangular paralleliped with
dimenions <i>n<sub>x</sub></i>,<i>n<sub>y</sub></i>, <i>n<sub>z</sub></i>.
The arrays `pix` and `ib` are are also dimensioned to the system
size.  The array `ib` has 27 components, for the 27 neighbors of a node.
Note that the program is set up at present to have at most 50
different phases.  This can easily be changed, simply by changing
the dimensions of `dk`, `prob`, and `cmod`. The parameter `nphase` gives the
number of phases being considered in the problem.
