GEMIPM2K

Structure of the file list for starting FMT-GEM coupled modeling run (on the TNode level)

The test example (compiled in Win32) starts with the following command line (to be executed 
from the \standalone\node_gem subdirectory): 

### gemnode.exe tp_test/<TaskName>-dat.lst tp_test/<TaskName>-dbr-<node0>.dat > test.out
gemnode.exe tp_test/<TaskName>-dat.lst > test.out

where <TaskName> should be substituted by a string denoting the task name, e.g. MyTask.

## The file <TaskName>-dbr-<node0>.dat will be additionally read by the TNode example. 

The file "test.out" will contain console output during operation of the TNode example. 

The file <TaskName>-dat.lst has the following structure:

##-t "<TaskName>-ipm.dat" -t "<TaskName>-dch.dat", "<TaskName>-dbr-<node0>.dat", ## "<TaskName>-dbr-<node1>.dat" 
##[, ... ]

-t "<TaskName>-dch.dat" "<TaskName>-ipm.dat" "<TaskName>-dbr-<node0>.dat", "<TaskName>-dbr-<node1>.dat" 
[, ... ]

The -t key tells that the following files "<TaskName>-dch.dat", "<TaskName>-ipm.dat",
"<TaskName>-dbr-<node0>.dat" and so on are in free-text input format (see decription of the 
format in dch-dat-doc.txt, ipm-dat-doc.txt, and dbr-dat-doc.txt files). Alternative key: 
-b defines that the input files should be read in binary format (for instance, after the 
coupled problem has been interrupted and GEM files were written on disk in binary format). 

The order of files in the list is fixed: DCH_DAT file, IPM_DAT file, then DBR_DAT file (in TNode 
mode) or many DBR_DAT file names (comma-separated, in TNodeArray mode). The DBR-DAT files are 
used to set up initial composition and state in the nodes (one work node in TNode mode or many 
nodes in TNodeArray mode).   

The GEMIPM2K kernel will read specified input files in the following order: 

<TaskName>-dat.lst
<TaskName>-dch.dat
<TaskName>-ipm.dat
<TaskName>-dbr-<node0>.dat
............
<TaskName>-dbr-<nodeN>.dat

There can be many comma-separated files of DBR_DAT (node description) type, which will 
be read sequentially, but only the last one will remain loaded in the TNode example. 

The DCH_DAT file <TaskName>-dch.dat contains parts of chemical system definition (CSD) that can be 
requested both by GEM and by the FMT parts of the coupled code. Contents of this file will be placed 
in two memory data structures: (1) DATACH structure visible from both GEMIPM and the FMT part and 
(2) IPM (MULTI) structure - the internal work structure of GEMIPM2, not visible from the FMT part. 
The <TaskName>-dch.dat (and the DATACH structure) also contain dimensions and index lists that 
are needed for reading and accessing the DBR_DAT (node description) files like <TaskName>-dbr-<node0>.dat. Finally, the DATACH file and structure contains grid arrays of thermodynamic data used later on 
for automatic interpolation of gibbs energies G0, molar volumes V0 of components using given values 
of temperature T and pressure P in GEM IPM calculations for any node and time. 

The IPM_DAT file <TaskName>-ipm.dat contains additional data and numerical controls from the MULTI 
data strucutre that are necessary for the GEM IPM algorithm but are irrelevant for the FMT part. 

##As an option, the whole binary MULTI structure can be read from the <TaskName>.ipm binary file if 
##the -b key is set at the beginning in the <TaskName>-dat.lst file.

The file <TaskName>-dbr-<node0>.dat (read into the DATABR memory structure) contains parts of the 
chemical system definition that may be changed by the FMT part (input data of GEM such as T, P, 
bulk composition, metastability constraints) or are returned after the GEM IPM calculation to be 
utilized by the FMT part on the next time iteration. 

The <TaskName>-dat.lst file may contain any number of (comma-separated) DATABR file names. 
These files will be read one-by-one: (a) into the same work DATABR structure on the level of TNode 
examples and coupling of GEMIPM with already existing FMT codes; (b) to be distributed into 
different DATABR structures for many nodes on the level of TNodeArray example (and coupled FMT-GEM 
codes written on the basis of TNodeArray); see documentation to the TNodeArray example for more 
information in this respect.  

The whole collection of GEMIPM2 input files describing the chemical system for starting the 
coupled examples can be obtained directly from the GEMS-PSI code (either in GEM2MT module or, 
for a single equilibrium system, from the GEMS Single Thermodynamic System dialog, using the
"Data" "Write IPM ..." menu command after calulation of the equilibrium state). 
Later on, the text input files can be modified by the user according to descriptions of file 
formats found in the accompanying files dch-dat-doc.txt, ipm-dat-doc.txt, and dbr-dat-doc.txt. 
The format in three file types is essentially the same, only the data tags and fields differ.
