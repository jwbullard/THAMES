## portcem-for-alite

This example illustrates that one can simulate alite hydration using the GEM
input for a full portland cement.  The caveat is that the user must still
ensure non-zero values for all the ICs that are listed in the GEM data input files.
The most straightforward way to do this is to include small amounts of ICs in
the initial solution.  This is illustrated in the chemistry-alite.xml file.
